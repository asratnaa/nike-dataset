Nike Sales Analysis: Retail Store Performance & Sales Methods (2020-2021)

This repository contains data analysis project, focusing on Nike sales data from a Kaggle dataset. The project highlights:

1. Comparison of Nike Sales Across Different Retail Stores: Analyzing sales differences by store.
2. Total Sales Across Various Sales Methods: Comparing the effectiveness of online vs. in-store sales.
3. Comparing Product Sales Between 2020 and 2021: Observing product performance changes over one years.

The analysis was done using Python, Pandas, and Google Data Studio to create clear and informative visualizations. This is part of my journey to develop data analysis skills
